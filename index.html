          <li>Some key components I have learned about the body element.</li>
          <ol>1. There are opening tags and closing tags. With the difference being, closing tags have a slash before the code.</ol>
          <ol>2. Also in the body, the level of headings use h# starting with h1, h2, h3, etc.</ol>
          <ol>3. The element, p, represents a paragraph or block of text.</ol>
          <ol>4. The element, ul, represents unordered lists.</ol>
          <ol>5. The element, ol, represents ordered lists.</ol>
          <ol>6. The element, li, represents listed items.</ol>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
        <li>A internal style sheet contains CSS rules in the HTML file in the head section of the HTML file. internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>We use an external CSS style sheet keeps the CSS rules in a separate file to make design changes easier. It must be linked in the HTML file between the head element.</s li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>Refer back to modules 3.2.1 to 3.2.5 to review.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Refer to Pre-Work 3.3.1 for additional information</li>
        <li>JavaScript has the ability to power a website with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Order matters code affects the outcome.</li>
        <li>Conditional statements such as "if" is used if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li> 
        <li>If the condition isn't true or has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
        <li>An index is a location for the data item in the array, beginning with the first item as 0, not 1.</li>
        <li>A for loop uses the preditable pattern of indices to peform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. The index and array's length are needed to accomplish this.</li>
        <li>A for loops must contain 3 important steps:</li>
        <ol>The first statement determines the starting point of our loop.</ol>
        <ol>The second is the statement. The nunber of variables must be less than the length of the array.</ol>
        <ol>The final statement is what allows to iterate over each item.</ol>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
