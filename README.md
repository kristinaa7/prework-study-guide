## Boot Camp Pre-work Study Guide for Students
On October 31st, 2022, I will begin taking an online bootcamp through the University of Washington to learn how to code. I am motivated by the opportunity to learn more about an opportunity for create something that can make a difference in this world and to showcase my talents of juggling being a mom and young working professional. I built this project to learn through examples and provide hands-on experience on the basics of coding. I am also able to keep track and update my notes from the Pre-Work to reference back to, as well as to add this first project to add to my growing portolio. During this study and investigation, I learned a lot of key concepts on three cornstone languages in web development. I am confident that the more I practice and put my time into perfecting my coding skills, the better I will be to become a successful web developer.

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
